The Concise TypeScript Book provides a comprehensive and succinct overview of TypeScript's capabilities. It offers clear explanations covering all aspects found in the latest version of the language, from its powerful type system to advanced features. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this book is an invaluable resource to enhance your understanding and proficiency in TypeScript.

This book is completely Free and Open Source.

I believe that high-quality technical education should be accessible to everyone, which is why I keep this book free and open.

If the book helped you squash a bug, understand a tricky concept, or move forward in your career, please consider supporting my work by paying what you want (suggested price: $15) or by sponsoring a coffee. Your support helps me keep the content up to date and the digital lights on.
